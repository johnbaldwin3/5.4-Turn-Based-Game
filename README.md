------
A collaborative team project, two other students and myself, worked together to manage a project as a team designing a turn-based game similar to the idea behind Final Fantasy. This project relied heavily on the collaboration and organization needed in a group project, as well as managing the version control between 3 different codes being constantly updated.

Created with HTML, Sass, Handlebars, and JavaScript.
